# Summer of Data Science 2018 and 100 Days of Code

This document will track my progress for the summer 2018 as I tackle both the #100DaysOfCode and #SODS18 challenges! I will post on Twitter from time to time, but most updates will be done on Github.
Goals:
- 50 Medium/Hard level questions on LeetCode
- June project: A character network using D3.js and Python to crawl the data from wikia fandom pages
- July project: An AI Solver using Reinforcement Learning and at least 2 different strategies for comparison
- August project: Surprise project, but ideally related to Data Engineering and real-time data streaming
