# Summer of Data Science 2018 and 100 Days of Code

This document will track my progress for the summer 2018 as I tackle both the #100DaysOfCode and #SODS18 challenges! I will post on Twitter from time to time, but most updates will be done on Github.
Goals:
- 50 Medium/Hard level questions on LeetCode
- June project: A character network using D3.js and Python to crawl the data from wikia fandom pages
- July project: An AI Solver using Reinforcement Learning and at least 2 different strategies for comparison
- August project: Surprise project, but ideally related to Data Engineering and real-time data streaming

## Week 1: 06/12/2018-06/19/2018
- Day 1: Started working on the Python Crawler to find all the characters related to the root/seed/main character of a series.
- Day 2: Was able to find all main information for each character (URL link, name, relationship, description, season introduced) as well as find a list of its relationships (family, romances, friends, enemies). Started working on making the algorithm BFS.
- Day 3: Did 5 Leetcode medium questions: 535, 654, 797, 807, 814
- Day 4: Did 2 Leetcode medium questions: 537, 763 and went through all my newsletters about AI/DS/CS
- Day 5: Did 7 Leetcode medium questions: 17, 22, 34, 47, 50, 54, 338 and 1 Coding Challenge
- Day 6: Back to Wiki Crawler, a lot of debugging for edge cases
- Day 7: Set-up the front-end and structure of the final Visualization

## Week 2: 06/20/2018-06/27/2018
- Day 8: Did 5 Leetcode medium questions: 413, 442, 508, 526, 791
- Day 9: Updated personal website
- Day 10: Finish Python Data Crawler and import/clean data in JSON file
- Day 11: Solved 3 Leetcode medium questions: 46, 194, 238 and searched about Spark
- Day 12: Spark Udemy Course
- Day 13: Spark Udemy Course
- Day 14: Reading Designing Data-Intensive Applications Book
